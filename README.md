# CSP 554 - Big Data Technologies Final Project

# Empirical Evaluation of Distributed Key/Value Storage Systems

## Pratul Palaniappa Muthuraja - A20444489

## Abstract

In this project I will be evaluating popular distributed key/value storage systems
namely Cassandra, MongoDB, and CouchDB and compare them to an existing
literature of ZHT (Zero-Hop distributed Hash Table). I propose to run this project in a
distributed cloud-based test bed for which the configuration is TBD. For each
system I will work with 2, 4, and 8 nodes. The aim of this paper is to compare the
existing literature with other distributed hash tables and key/value storage systems
and show which of these offers the best performance in terms of the features and
portability supported.

Here is the paper used as reference for this project - [ZHT Paper](http://datasys.cs.iit.edu/publications/2013_IPDPS13_ZHT.pdf)

## TODO

- Evaluation Code for each Systems
- Python Code to plot values obtained to generate graph
- Report
- Requirements file
